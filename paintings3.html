    <div class="about">
    <p>
    Under the Cherry Tree was painted by Lavery in the village of Grez-sur-Loing, near Paris,
    where artists had gathered since the 1860s. It was created in 1883-1884 using a new 'plein-air'
    style that involved working outside directly from nature. Originally titled On the Loing:
    An Afternoon Chat, the painting was larger and more ambitious than any of Lavery's previous works,
    displaying the painterly techniques he had recently acquired through study in France.
    The composition of the painting is divided into three distinct areas, each painted using a
    different technique, such as the finely observed vegetation in the foreground and the misty
    rendition of bridge and foliage in the background.

    <p>
    Lavery frequently painted his family members, notably his daughter Eileen,
    who is shown in these two paintings at various phases of her life. The sole offspring
    of Lavery's first wife, who passed away soon after giving birth to him, was Eileen.
    Lavery concentrated on the delicate tonal gradations between white and gray in
    Eileen's gown and veil when creating this drawing for a larger painting.
    Lavery was greatly influenced by James Abbott McNeill Whistler, especially by his controlled
    and delicate color harmonies. Following their introduction in 1887, Lavery and Whistler kept
    in touch often and collaborated to establish the International Society of Sculptors,
    Painters, and Gravers in 1897-8. While Whistler was living with Lavery during a break
    from her convent boarding school, Lavery painted Eileen, who was seven years old.

    <p>
         Lavery's doctor recommended him against enlisting in the Army during World War I,
        but he still wanted to help out. In 1914, he painted the first injured soldiers receiving
        care at the London Hospital. He had intended to travel to the Western Front to paint true
        wartime scenes, but his wife Hazel dissuaded him, so he instead persisted in painting in London.
        The afternoon of July 7, 1917, when German aircraft emerged in the sky over London and were
        engaged by British aircraft, is depicted in the painting Dawn Raid from my Studio Window.
        Lavery originally included a statue of the Virgin Mary in the painting, but eventually painted
        it out, maybe to obscure the memory of his wife's death. The painting depicts Hazel watching the
        scene with anxiety. With rapid, fluid brushstrokes, the painting conveys the bustle inside
        his studio and the foreboding presence of the planes outside.
