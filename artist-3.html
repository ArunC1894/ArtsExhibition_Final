        MJohn Lavery was born in inner North Belfast and moved to Scotland as a child, where he attended Haldane Academy in Glasgow. <br />
        In 1878, he established his own studio which was destroyed in a fire the following year. <br />
        With the £300 insurance payout, he studied at Heatherley's School in London for a year. <br />
        Lavery then went to Paris to study at the Académie Julian in the early 1880s before returning to Glasgow <br />
        where he was associated with the Glasgow School.<br />

        In 1888, Lavery was commissioned to paint the state visit of Queen Victoria to the Glasgow International Exhibition, <br />
        which launched his career as a society painter. He moved to London soon after and became a successful portrait artist.<br />
        Overall, John Lavery was a prominent artist of his time, and his association with influential patrons such as William Burrell <br />
        helped to further his career as a society painter. His talent as a portrait artist was widely recognized, <br />
        and his portrait of Mary Burrell is a notable example of his work.<br /><br />
